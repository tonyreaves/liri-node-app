# liri-node-app

Liri is a robot app that uses the Spotify, Online Movie Database and Twitter APIs to return information requested by users.

For information about a song, type "node liri.js spotify-this" followed by the song name.

For information about a movie, type "node liri.js movie-this" followed by the movie name.

For my latest tweets, type "node liri.js my-tweets" and you'll get 20 of your latest tweets, minus replies.

There's also the random.txt file. Type "node liri.js do-what-it-says" to have the program take the file text in as a command. The default is 'spotify-this-song "I Want it That Way"' but you can change it then run do-what-it-says so the computer can take the new command.
